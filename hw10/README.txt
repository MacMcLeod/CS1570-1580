This code contains additional features. 
1. Around the houses, fences (denoted by 'F') are generated. When Milhouse encounters a bully,
he see's if there is a fence nearby. Bullies are scary! He has a 40% to esacape said bully by 
jumping the fence. The jump function is called inside the punch function. Highwater pants sure 
do come in handy! If he does not escape, then the rest of bully's punch function 
(with the 80-20 outcome) will run.
2. It seems silly for a bully to stand around, looking for a victim to walk right by her/him. Therefore,
each bully has been assigned a 'territory' that they patrol, scouting out their victims.
